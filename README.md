# ðŸš€ API Automation Framework

This is a **robust, scalable API test automation framework** built using:
- **Maven** â€“ build & dependency management  
- **RestAssured** â€“ API testing client  
- **TestNG** â€“ test execution & reporting  
- **Jackson** â€“ JSON serialization/deserialization  
- **SLF4J + Logback** â€“ logging  

It is designed to be **modular, maintainable, and industry-ready**, supporting environment management, reusable API clients, retries, logging, and data-driven testing.
